 Announcing Aesara 0.5
===========================

## You can select and adapt one of the following templates.

## Basic text for major version release:

This is a release for a major version, with lots of new
features, bug fixes, and some interface changes (deprecated or
potentially misleading features were removed).

Upgrading to Aesara 0.5 is recommended for everyone, but you should first make
sure that your code does not raise deprecation warnings with Aesara 0.4.1.
Otherwise, in one case the results can change. In other cases, the warnings are
turned into errors (see below for details).

For those using the bleeding edge version in the
git repository, we encourage you to update to the `0.5` tag.


## Basic text for major version release candidate:

This is a release candidate for a major version, with lots of new
features, bug fixes, and some interface changes (deprecated or
potentially misleading features were removed).

The upgrade is recommended for developers who want to help test and
report bugs, or want to use new features now.  If you have updated
to 0.5rc1, you are highly encouraged to update to 0.5rc2.

For those using the bleeding edge version in the
git repository, we encourage you to update to the `0.5rc2` tag.

Description
-----------

Aesara is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and
efficiently evaluate mathematical expressions involving
multi-dimensional arrays. It is built on top of NumPy. Aesara
features:

 * tight integration with NumPy: a similar interface to NumPy's.
   numpy.ndarrays are also used internally in Aesara-compiled functions.
 * transparent use of a GPU: perform data-intensive computations much faster than on a CPU.
 * efficient symbolic differentiation: Aesara can compute derivatives
   for functions of one or many inputs.
 * speed and stability optimizations: avoid nasty bugs when computing
   expressions such as log(1+ exp(x)) for large values of x.
 * dynamic C code generation: evaluate expressions faster.
 * extensive unit-testing and self-verification: includes tools for
   detecting and diagnosing bugs and/or potential problems.

Aesara has been powering large-scale computationally intensive
scientific research since 2007, but it is also approachable
enough to be used in the classroom (IFT6266 at the University of Montreal).
