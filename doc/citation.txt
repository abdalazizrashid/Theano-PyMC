Aesara Citation Policy
======================

If you use Aesara for academic research, you are highly encouraged (though not
required) to cite the following paper:

* Aesara Development Team. `"Aesara: A Python framework for fast computation of mathematical expressions"
  <http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.02688.pdf>`_.
  (:download:`short BibTeX <aesara-short.bib>`, :download:`full BibTeX <aesara-full.bib>`)

Aesara is primarily developed by academics, and so citations matter a lot to
us. As an added benefit, you increase Aesara's exposure and potential user
(and developer) base, which is to the benefit of all users of Aesara. Thanks
in advance!

Previously, we asked users of Aesara to cite the two papers below.
However, many members of our community have contributed to Aesara in the
meantime, and it is inconvenient to cite multiple papers. We intend to
introduce new papers periodically, and only ask for users to cite the
single most recent paper with the most comprehensive author list.

Earlier articles:

* F. Bastien, P. Lamblin, R. Pascanu, J. Bergstra, I. Goodfellow,
  A. Bergeron, N. Bouchard, D. Warde-Farley and Y. Bengio.
