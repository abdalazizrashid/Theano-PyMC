"Thank YOU for correcting it so quickly. I wish all packages I worked
with would have such an active maintenance - this is as good as it
gets :-)"

"Aesara rocks incredibly. It's like the holy grail of linear algebra
computations."

I am completely new to aesara and after running the deep-learning
tutorial and see the examples actually work on my GTX 275 I must say I
am 100% sold on the aesara approach; this is an amazing project that
deserves broad recognition among the scientific python community.
